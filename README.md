# Calculate Unique Groups
With this tool you can create groups where after each round new unique groups are created 
where everyone in the new group has not previously had any of the others in the group in a group.

You can try it out [here](https://alphasoundz.github.io/calculateGroups/)

## Run it localhost
If you want to run it on your machine, you need to run it on a server:
1. Navigate to the root folder of the project
2. run ```python -m http.server 8000``` (or in python 2: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```)
3. open in a webbrowser http://localhost:8000/
